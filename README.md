# Two-state-safe-speed-model

This code is a cellular automaton model for simulating traffic spatiotemporal patterns. And the code is written in **Python**. Only the most useful packages, numpy, matplotlib are used.

This is the **circular road** condition only, the open road with an on-ramp version will be added later.

In ./figs folder, there are two figs made by the code. You can compare them with the figs in the publised paper.
