# Two-state-safe-speed-model

This code is a cellular automaton model for simulating traffic spatiotemporal patterns. And the code is written in Python. Only the most useful packages, numpy, matplotlib are used.

This is only the circular road condition, the open road with an on-ramp version will be added later.
